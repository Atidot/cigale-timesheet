import redmine info -- paging in redmine if the basic import was done!

bug in git, parse error, see gmail

13.3.2013 events not in timerange

try to re-enable HTTPS for ical, segfault since http-streams..

for source version control, in the details show the diffstat; done for
GIT, could still be done for SVN and HG.

for emails, nice display if there is an attachment instead of dumping
the base64. a download button would be groovy (or inline preview for
images).

for emails check for a library, if there is none extract one from this
app, make regression tests and so on.

make a bootstrap-based GUI. at first allow the settings to be set in the
GUI.

HTML formatting in emails can spread to my pages: use an iframe

when clicking on an event, highlight the html table row with the same
color as the preview pane background so it's clear to which row the
preview pane refers.

clear the preview pane when changing day.
