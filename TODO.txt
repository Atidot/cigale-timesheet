migrate to scotty instead of snap? https://github.com/xich/scotty

add withOpenSSL and go back to SSL for ICAL
try to re-enable HTTPS for ical, segfault since http-streams..

port to http-conduit with the new nice API i made.

make relocatable so i can start it from any folder.

redmine: make me a link to the bug, because I don't get the full info.

for source version control, in the details show the diffstat; done for
GIT, could still be done for SVN and HG.

for emails, nice display if there is an attachment instead of dumping
the base64. a download button would be groovy (or inline preview for
images).

for emails check for a library, if there is none extract one from this
app, make regression tests and so on.

make a bootstrap-based GUI. at first allow the settings to be set in the
GUI.

HTML formatting in emails can spread to my pages: use an iframe

clear the preview pane when changing day.

firefox google searches, maybe stackoverflow upvotes, dropbox subfolder
activity, google docs?
for firefox google searches: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/The_Places_database
