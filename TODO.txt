extract the config->plugin parameters patterns, uniformize the plugins
calling (list the plugins and have a loop, not individual calls to each
plugin, or maybe tie up plugins and their configuration.

for source version control, in the details show the diffstat and even
the diff. For the diffstat, should be easy with git, in fact I even
already parse the git diffstat..

for emails, nice display if there is an attachment instead of dumping
the base64. a download button would be groovy (or inline preview for
images).

for emails check for a library, if there is none extract one from this
app.

make a bootstrap-based GUI. at first allow the settings to be set in the
GUI.

HTML formatting in emails can spread to my pages: use an iframe

when clicking on an event, highlight the html table row with the same
color as the preview pane background so it's clear to which row the
preview pane refers.

clear the preview pane when changing day.
